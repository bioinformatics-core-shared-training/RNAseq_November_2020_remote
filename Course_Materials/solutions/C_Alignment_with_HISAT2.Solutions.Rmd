## 1 Indexing the genome for Hisat2

### Exercise 1

> 1. Check your current working directory and if necessary navigate to 
>    the `Course_Materials/` directory using the command `cd` (change
>    directory).
>
> `pwd` - to check **p**resent **w**working **d**irectory
> 
> `cd ~/Course_Materials`  - if necessary
>
> 2. Use `ls` to list the contents of the directory.  
> 
> `ls`
>
> 3. Use `ls references` to list the contents of the `references` directory.   
> 
> `ls references`
>
> 4. Make a directory called `hisat2_index_chr1` inside the `references`
>    directory.  This is where we will create our chr1 index.  
> 
> `mkdir references/hisat2_index_chr1`
>
> 5. Create the hisat2 index by runnning the following command: 
> 
> `hisat2-build -p 7 references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.chr1.fa references/hisat2_index_chr1/grcm38`
>    
> A) Why do we use `-p 7`? Take a look at `hisat2-build` help.
>
> `hisat2-build --help`
> The `-p` flag is used to instruct hisat2 about how many threads (processors) 
> it should use when running an operation. Using multiple processors in parallel
> speeds up the analysis.  In our case, the machines we are using have 8
> processors and so we tell hisat2 to use 7 of these which leaves one free.
>
> B) How many files are created? 
>
Hisat2 always creates 8 index files that start with our base name end with `.X.ht2`.
So in this case we have `mmu.GRCm38.1.ht2` to `mmu.GRCm38.8.ht2`.

## 2 Align with Hisat2

### Exercise 2 

> 1. Create a directory called `bam` (BAM will be our final aligned file
>    format, but we have one more step after alignment to get there).
>
> `mkdir bam`
>
> 3. Use hisat2 to align the fastq file. Use the following parameters
>       * Index (the full genome this time) - `references/hisat_index/mmu.GRCm38`
>       * Fastq file - `fastq/MCL1.DL.fastq.gz`
>       * Output file - `bam/SMCL1.DL.sam`
>       * Set the number of threads (number of processors to use) to 7 - check
>         the help page to find the appropriate flag
>       * Add the `-t` flag so that HISAT2 will print a time log to the console
>
> ```
> hisat2 -x references/hisat_index/mmu.GRCm38 \
>        -U fastq/MCL1.DL.fastq.gz \
>        -S bam/MCL1.DL.sam \
>        -p 7 \
>        -t
> ```

## 3 Convert the SAM output to BAM 

### Exercise 3

> 1. Transform your aligned SAM file in to a BAM file.
>
> `samtools view -b -@ 7 bam/MCL1.DL.sam > bam/MCL1.DL.bam`
>
> 2. Sort the BAM file
>
> `samtools sort -@ 7 bam/MCL1.DL.bam > bam/MCL1.DL.sorted.bam`
>
> 3. Index the sorted BAM file
>
> `samtools index bam/MCL1.DL.sorted.bam`  
> generates the file `bam/MCL1.DL.sorted.bam.bai`
>
