The list of differentially expressed genes is sometimes so long that its 
interpretation becomes cumbersome and time consuming. It may also be very
short while some genes have low p-value yet higher than the given threshold.

A common downstream procedure to combine information across genes is gene set testing.
It aims at finding pathways or gene networks the differentially expressed genes play a role in.

Various ways exist to test for enrichment of biological pathways. We will look
into over representation and gene set enrichment analysis.

A gene set comprises genes that share a biological function, chromosomal location, or any other
relevant criterion.

<!--
- Define gene set
- gene set == "pathway"
- over-represented == enriched
ie pathway A is enriched in our diff exp gene list

# Over-representation

## Method

This method tests whether genes in a pathway are present in a subset of our data
more than expected (explanations derived from the [clusterProfiler manual](https://yulab-smu.github.io/clusterProfiler-book/index.html)).

Genes in the experiment are split in two ways:

* annotated to the pathway or not
* differentially expressed or not

We can then create a contingency table with:

* rows: genes in pathway or not
* columns: genes differentially expressed or not

Example:

```{r}
d <- data.frame(
  diffExpNo=c(1980, 17920),
  diffExpYes=c(20, 80))
row.names(d) <- c("pathwayYes", "pathwayNo")
d
```

<!--
Draws == DEGs
Success == in pathway
-->

For a given pathway:

* N: total number of genes in the background set, e.g. all genes tested
* M: number of genes within that background distribution that are annotated to the pathway
* n: number of differentially expressed genes
* k: number of differentially expressed genes that are annotated to the pathway

Significance can then be assessed with a the hypergeometric distribution:

<!-- over-representation p-value -->
![](../images/overRepPvalHyperGeoFormula.png)

The test above is identical to the one-tailed Fisher's exact test.

```{r}
fisher.test(d, alternative = "greater")
```

To save time and effort there are a number of packages that make applying this 
test to a large number of gene sets simpler, and which will import gene lists 
for testing from various sources.

Today we will use `clusterProfiler`.

<!-- KEGG pathway enrichment analysis -->

## `clusterProfiler`

`clusterprofiler` [@Yu2012] supports direct online access of the current KEGG
database, rather than relying on R annotation packages, it also provides some
nice visualisation options (KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes).

```{r loadClusterProfiler, message=FALSE}
library(clusterProfiler)
search_kegg_organism('mmu', by='kegg_code')
```

### KEGG enrichment analysis

The input for the KEGG enrichment is list of gene IDs for significant genes. 

We now load the R object keeping the outcome of the differential expression 
analysis for the LvV contrast.

```{r loadData}
load("Robjects/Annotated_Results_LvV.RData")
```

We will only use genes that have an adjusted p-value (FDR) of less than 0.04 and
an absolute fold change greater than 2. We need to remember to eliminate genes
with missing values in the FDR as a result of the independent filtering by
DESeq2.

For this tool we need to use Entrez IDs, so we will need to eliminate genes with 
missing values in 'Entrez'.

```{r enrichKEGG, eval=FALSE}
sigGenes <- shrinkLvV %>% 
    drop_na(Entrez, FDR) %>% 
    filter(FDR < 0.05 & abs(logFC) > 1) %>% 
    pull(Entrez)

kk <- enrichKEGG(gene = sigGenes, organism = 'mmu')
head(kk, n=10)
```

```{r enrichKEGGprint, echo=FALSE}
sigGenes <- shrinkLvV %>% 
    drop_na(Entrez, FDR) %>% 
    filter(FDR < 0.05 & abs(logFC) > 1) %>% 
    pull(Entrez)

kk <- enrichKEGG(gene = sigGenes, organism = 'mmu')
head(kk, n=10) %>%  as_tibble()
```


#### Visualise a pathway

##### In a browser

`clusterProfile` has a function `browseKegg` that allows you to view the KEGG
pathway in in your browser with the genes that are in our gene highlighted.

```{r browseKegg}
browseKEGG(kk, 'mmu03320')
```

##### As a file

The package `pathview` [@Luo2013] can be used to generate figures of KEGG 
pathways. 

One advantage over the `clusterProfiler` browser method is that the genes can be
coloured according to their fold change levels in our data. To do this we need
to pass `pathview` a named vector of fold change data (actually you could
colour by any numeric vector, e.g. p-value).

The package plots the KEGG pathway to a `png` file in the working directory.

```{r pathview, message=F}
library(pathview)
logFC <- annotLvV$logFC
names(logFC) <- annotLvV$Entrez
pathview(gene.data = logFC, 
         pathway.id = "mmu03320", 
         species = "mmu", 
         limit = list(gene=5, cpd=1))
```

> use genes that are statistically significant at FDR < 0.01

# GSEA analysis

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identifies gene sets that are related to the
difference of interest between samples [@Subramanian15545].

The software is distributed by the 
[Broad Institute](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp)
and is freely available for use by academic and non-profit organisations.
The Broad also provide a number of very well curated gene sets
for testing against your data - the [Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). 
These are collections of human genes, however. Fortunately, these lists
have been translated to mouse equivalents by the Walter+Eliza Hall Institute
Bioinformatics service and made available for 
[download](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/MSigDB/).

## Method

The analysis is performed by:

1. ranking all genes in the data set  
2. identifying the rank positions of all members of the gene set in the 
ranked data set
3. calculating an enrichment score (ES) that represents the difference 
between the observed rankings and that which would be expected assuming a random 
rank distribution.
 
The article describing the original software is available 
[here](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545.long), while this [commentary on GSEA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1266131/) provides a shorter description.

![](../images/gseaArticleFig1.png)

We will use the [`fgsea`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/fgsea/inst/doc/fgsea-tutorial.html) 
package [@Sergushichev2016] that implements the same algorithm in R. 
'fgsea' stands for' "fast preranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)".

```{r fgsea}
library(fgsea)
```

## Ranking Data

We need to provide `fgsea` with a vector containing numeric data by which it should 
rank the genes. To start with we will simply use a rank based on their fold 
change. We do not need to rank the genes ourselves, `fgsea` will do this based
on the data we provide.

We must exclude genes for which we do not have Entrez IDs. Also, we should 
use the shrunk LFC values.

```{r preparedata}
gseaDat <- filter(shrinkLvV, !is.na(Entrez))

rankData <- gseaDat$logFC
names(rankData) <- gseaDat$Entrez
head(rankData)
```

## Load pathways

We will load the MSigDB Hallmark gene set. The pathways RData file loads a new 
object call Mm.H (`H` for **H**allmark gene set), which is a list of gene sets. 
The names of the vectors in list are the names of gene sets and each vector 
contains Entrez IDs for the genes in the gene set.

```{r loadPathways}
load("Robjects/mouse_H_v5.RData")
head(names(Mm.H))
head(Mm.H[[1]])
```

## Conduct analysis

```{r runFgsea}
fgseaRes <- fgsea(Mm.H, 
                  rankData, 
                  minSize = 15, 
                  maxSize = 500)
```

The warning produced indicates that there are few genes that have the same fold
change and so are ranked equally. `fgsea` arbitrarily determines which
comes first in the ranked list. As long as this number is small it shouldn't
significantly affect the results. If the number is large something is 
suspicious about the fold change results.

Lets look at the top 10 results.

```{r top10pathways, eval=FALSE}
fgseaRes %>% 
    arrange(desc(abs(NES))) %>% 
    top_n(10, -padj)
```

```{r top10pathwaysPrint, echo=FALSE}
fgseaRes %>% 
    arrange(desc(abs(NES))) %>% 
    top_n(10, -padj) %>%  
    as_tibble()
```

## Enrichment score plot

```{r gseaEnrichmentPlot}
plotEnrichment(Mm.H[["HALLMARK_ESTROGEN_RESPONSE_EARLY"]], rankData)
```

Remember to check the [GSEA 
article](http://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545.full) for the complete 
explanation.
